1. Refactoring involves reorganising code without changing it's functionality. Examples include:
- Reorganising code into functions to remove redundant code
- Renaming variables
- Changing data types used for particular functions

2. Data science problems often involve complex, real-world data. Structures can be inconsistent and involve irregular problems; messy data can then lead to messy solutions.

3.
- Organise code into functions
- Organise code into classes
- Break down large functions into smaller functions
