# COMP 370 Homework 8 ‚Äì Data Annotation
Assigned Oct 25, 2024
Due Nov 1, 2024 @ 11:59 PM
In this assignment, we‚Äôre interested in the main topics discussed on the /r/mcgill subreddit vs. the /r/concordia subreddit.  We‚Äôll do this using human annotation ‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre the annotator üòä
## Task 1: Data collection
First, let‚Äôs collect some reddit posts (using the /new.json endpoint ‚Äì details here). We‚Äôll collect two data files. One from the McGill subreddit and one from the Concordia subreddit.
For the purpose of this assignment, collect them manually. Meaning, in a web browser, get the json dump and download it to a file. You should have a a mcgill.json file and a concordia.json file.

## Task 2: Prep for coding
Write a script extract_to_tsv.py that accepts one of the files you collected from Reddit and outputs a random selection of posts from that file to a tsv (tab separated value) file.  It should function like this:

	python3 extract_to_tsv.py -o <out_file> <json_file> <num_posts_to_output>

If <num_posts_to_output> is greater than the file length, then the script should just output all lines.  If there are more than <num_posts_to_output> (which is likely the case), then it should randomly select num_posts_to_output (the parameter you passed to the script) of them and just output those.

The output format (written to out_file) is:

	Name <tab> title <tab> coding
	<name of first post chosen> <tab> <title of first post chosen> <tab>
	<name of second post chosen> <tab> <title of the second post chosen> <tab>
	‚Ä¶
	<name of the n‚Äôth post chosen> <tab> <title of the nth post chosen> <tab>

Here is an example:

Name	title	coding
t3_jmmrja	"Easy Computer Science classes"	
t3_jmm91k	"Cloudberry (+ Tri-pawed squirrel) Appreciation Post"	
t3_jmg17h	"Breaking a lease over a persistent cockroach infestation?"	
t3_jmfc0t	"Don't know how to cook"	
t3_jmfj91	"my bike is falling apart"	

Note that:
-	we‚Äôre including the ‚Äúname‚Äù field because it uniquely identifies the post, in case you ever need to go back and check something in the original data
-	whitespace between column value and the tab is optional
-	the third column ‚Äúcoding‚Äù is intentionally blank.  We‚Äôll be completing that in the next task.
We also need a specific output for this exercise (which will be completed on task 3). Run the following:
python3 extract_to_tsv.py -o annotated_mcgill.tsv mcgill.json 50
python3 extract_to_tsv.py -o annotated_concordia.tsv concordia.json 50

That means, run your script on your McGill and Concordia files you created, 50 lines in each. The output files, annotated_mcgill.tsv and annotated_concordia.tsv, should be submitted in the submission_template. Please check the README.md for further information.

## Task 3: Develop an ontology
We‚Äôre analyzing what these posts are about. You need to develop an ontology. We‚Äôre aiming for 5-8 categories (this tells you the level of resolution).
Using the files you produced in Task 2,  annotated_mcgill.tsv and annotated_concordia.tsv, conduct an open-coding of those posts. (It‚Äôs easiest to use something like Excel for this part of the process).
1.	Start by going through all the posts and putting down the category that ‚Äúseems right to you‚Äù
2.	Review all the ‚Äúcategories‚Äù that you put down. You might have a lot. Consolidate them down to 5-15 categories.
3.	Go back through an annotate posts again using just those ones. Keep track of any issues you encountered.
4.	Based on your experience with the second round, tighten up the categories one more time so that you have the 5-8 in your typology. (if you‚Äôre not there yet, just repeat steps 3 & 4 again, possibly a couple times)

## Submission Instructions
Submit a zip containing:
-	mcgill.json
-	concordia.json
-	annotated_mcgill.tsv
-	annotated_concordia.tsv
-	extract_to_tsv.py
-	README.md
o	In this file, list the final categories you came up with.
